/**
Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always ones may appear first and then zeros.

Example 1:

Input: mat =
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]],
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation:
The number of soldiers for each row is:
row 0 -> 2
row 1 -> 4
row 2 -> 1
row 3 -> 2
row 4 -> 5
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]

Example 2:

Input: mat =
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]],
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation:
The number of soldiers for each row is:
row 0 -> 1
row 1 -> 4
row 2 -> 1
row 3 -> 1
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
2 <= n, m <= 100
1 <= k <= m
matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
