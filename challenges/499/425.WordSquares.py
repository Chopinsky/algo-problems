'''
Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares 
you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and 
column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, 
numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms 
a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y

Note:

There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
All words will have the exact same length.
Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
Example 1:

Input:
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

Output:
[
  [ "wall",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ],
  [ "ball",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ]
]

Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not 
matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

Example 2:

Input:
["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

Output:
[
  [ "baba",
    "abat",
    "baba",
    "atan"
  ],
  [ "b a b a",
    "a b a t",
    "b a b a",
    "a t a l"
  ]
]

Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not 
matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
